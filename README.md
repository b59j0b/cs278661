Environmental   Survey   and Monitoring:   2024   -   2025
Overview   of Short   Communication   ReportsYou   are   to   write   to   short   summary   reports   on   a   given   environmental   survey   approach   that   has   been   undertaken during the course. The    reports should outline the study site, aims   and objectives,   the   methods used   and briefly   an   analysis   of the   results   that   were gathered.These reports   are   designed to provide the   reader   with   a   concise but   informative   overview   of   what   you   did, the findings and some brief   interpretation of   the outputs.   They   are   not   comprehensive   assessments   of an approach, but rather an example of   the application of   an   approach to measuring   the   environment.
Guidance
The   information   provided   below   is   for   guidance   only.   You do   not   have   to    strictly adhere   to every   suggestion, but   ideally   follow   the   main   points:
Structure
The   report   should   follow   the   suggested   structure:
1.          IntroductionIntroduce   the   subject   area,   the    concepts   behind   the   monitoring    approach   and   the   rationale   for   the   application.   You   should   aim   to   provide   anon-expert   a   good   foundation   to   understand   the   remainder   of the   report   and   highlight why   the   approach   can be useful   fo代 写Environmental Survey and Monitoring: 2024 - 2025Python

2.          Methods and   DataDescribe   the   application   of the   survey   approach   to   a   set   of   data   or   an   environmental   problem.   Here   you   should   describe   data   collection   techniques   (either   the   physical   approaches   to   gathering   primary   data   or the   electronic   sources), their   alternation   or transformation if required   and the   software used   for   analysis.   You   should be   explicit but brief here   –   we   do   not   need   to   know   every   step   of the   procedure   but   should have   an   idea   of what was   completed.
3.          Results   and AnalysisHere you   should present 1-2   (2 max) key   figures   (i.e.   charts, graphs,   illustrations,   tables   etc)   and   briefly describe   the   results   and   what   they   mean.   In   this   section   it   is   important   to   display   information   clearly   and   effectively, but   do   not   provide   interpretations   at   this   stage.
4.          Discussion   and   ConclusionConcisely,   evaluate   the   findings   considering   relevant   literature   (1-2   key   references)   and   reflect   on   the   advantages and disadvantages      of    the approach in relation to providing information to inform   environmental   management,   policy   or   other   end users   of the   monitoring   approach.
